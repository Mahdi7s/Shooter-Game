I developed this classic childhood game five years ago using Unity3D & C#.
It looks like "Stickman Sniper" or "Clear Vision" with a fun story. 

The game's story is about neighbors in an alley, and for each level, one of the neighbors made a mistake, and you should punish them with your customized blowgun.

### Wind direction and speed, remaining time & number of bullets are three things that increase the challenges of the game levels.

You can download the APK file here and play the game on your android device: <br>
